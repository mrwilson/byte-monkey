Byte-Monkey is a small Java library for testing failure scenarios in JVM applications - it works by instrumenting application code on the fly to deliberately introduce faults like exceptions and latency. Original blogpost [here](http://blog.probablyfine.co.uk/2016/05/30/announcing-byte-monkey.html).


## Download

Latest version: [1.0.0](https://github.com/mrwilson/byte-monkey/releases/download/1.0.0/byte-monkey.jar)

## How to use

```bash
java -javaagent:byte-monkey.jar -jar your-java-app.jar
```

## Supported Modes

 * **Fault**: Throw exceptions from methods that declare those exceptions
 * **Latency**: Introduce latency on method-calls
 * **Nullify**: Replace the first non-primitive argument to the method with *null*
 * **Short-circuit(working)**: Throw corresponding exceptions in the very beginning of try blocks

## Options

 * `mode`: What mode to run in - currently supports `fault`, `latency`, `nullify`, `scircuit`, and `analyzetc`. **Default is fault**
 * `rate`: Value between 0 and 1 - how often to activate the fault. **Default is 1, i.e. 100%**
 * `filter`: Only instrument packages or methods matching the (java-style) regex. **Default is .*, i.e. all methods**

byte-monkey is configured with a comma-separated key-value pair string of the options as the agent argument.

```bash
java -javaagent:byte-monkey.jar=mode:fault,rate:0.5,filter:uk/co/probablyfine/ -jar your-java-app.jar
```

The example above would run in fault mode, activating on 50% of eligible method calls, for anything in the package tree below `uk.co.probablyfine`

When you want to analyze the try-catch blocks info, you can also set byte-monkey into pom.xml, like this:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.19.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <!-- Java 7 introduced stricter verification and changed the class format a bitâ€”to contain a stack map used to verify that code is correct. -->
                <!-- Java version or bytecode instrumentation could both be to blame. -->
                <!-- So we just close verify to make our short-circuit testing work -->
                <argLine>-noverify -javaagent:byte-monkey.jar=mode:analyzetc,filter:your/root/package/name</argLine>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

With this configuration, when you run `mvn test`, byte-monkey will detect all the try-catch blocks covered by test cases and inject a logging method into try block. So that you can get some logs to help your analysis. Logs are something like this:

```
----
INFO ByteMonkey try catch index 0 @ L1289479439, copyPropertiesWithExclude @ com.github.sworm.spojo.utils.SpojoUtils
INFO ByteMonkey testCase: copyInclude2ndLevelComplexProperty @ com.github.sworm.spojo.utils.SpojoUtilsMoreTest
----
```

`L1289479439` is a relative position of the try-catch block, because we analyze this from java byte-code, `index 0` indicates the number of this try block in the method. As for 1 try with n catch blocks, the index number will increase but the position stays the same. You can use [Spoon](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr) together to do more analysis, like the percentage of try-catch covered by test cases. With this data, we might detect more bugs from those try-catch blocks which are not covered by test cases. We can also do the specific exception injection because we have obtained all the try-catch positions and exception types.

As for specific fault injection, you can use the following command:

```bash
java -javaagent:byte-monkey.jar=mode:scircuit,filter:package/path/ClassName/MethodName,tcindex=0 -jar your-java-app.jar
```

You can declare the exception type using `tcindex`, for example, the try block is corresponding to 2 catch blocks, then `tcindex 0` indicates the first type of exception in the catch block.

## Modes

### Fault

Running byte-monkey in `fault` mode will cause the first declared exception in a method signature to be thrown.

**CAVEAT**: Byte-Monkey can only create Exceptions that expose a public default constructor as a result of how it instantiates them. If such a constructor doesn't exist, it falls back to a `ByteMonkeyException` instead.

### Latency

Running byte-monkey in `latency` mode will cause the method to sleep before executing further instructions.

There is a configuration option available only during this mode:

 * `latency`: Duration (in millis) to wait on method calls, only valid when running in **Latency** mode. **Default is 100ms**

Example: `java -javaagent:byte-monkey.jar=mode:latency,rate:0.5,latency:150 -jar your-java-app.jar`

### Nullify

Running byte-monkey in `nullify` mode will replace the first non-primitive argument to the method call with a null value.

Methods with only primitive arguments or no arguments at all will not be affected by the agent in this mode.

### Short-circuit

Throw corresponding exceptions in the very beginning of try blocks.
What is short-circuit testing? What is this used for? You can read [this paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01062969/document) or [this blog](http://blog.gluckzhang.com/archives/107/) first.

### Try-catch Analysis

Before we do short-circuit testing, we should analyze the application first, basically about how many try-catch blocks are covered by test cases. Then we can choose a specific one to inject exception and observe the results of all test cases.

## Implementation Details

Byte-Monkey uses the JVM [Instrumentation API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html). Implementing the API enables you to register transformers that can iterate over (and transform) class files as they are loaded by the JVM. Byte-Monkey uses [Objectweb ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/) which comes packaged with the JDK to chance the underlying bytecode of loaded classes

### Injecting Failure

The bytecode of a simple "Hello, World!" method prior to having an exception injected looks like this:

```
  public void printSomething() throws java.io.IOException;
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #2                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
       3: ldc           #3                  // String Hello!
       5: invokevirtual #4                  // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
       8: return
```

After being transformed by the Byte-Monkey, it instead looks like this:
```
  public void printSomething() throws java.io.IOException;
    Code:
       0: ldc2_w        #18                 // double 0.5d
       3: invokestatic  #25                 // Method uk/co/probablyfine/bytemonkey/AddChanceOfFailure.shouldActivate:(D)Z
       6: ifeq          15
       9: ldc           #26                 // String java/io/IOException
      11: invokestatic  #32                 // Method uk/co/probablyfine/bytemonkey/CreateAndThrowException.throwOrDefault:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Throwable;
      14: athrow
      15: getstatic     #38                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      18: ldc           #40                 // String Hello!
      20: invokevirtual #46                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      23: return
```

This is the core of how Byte-Monkey works:

 * **0:** Load the failure injection rate onto the stack
 * **3:** A call to `AddChanceOfFailure.shouldActivate` which returns true/false depending on the rate
 * **6:** If `shouldActivate` was false, we jump straight to instruction 15 - the beginning of the original code.
 * **9:** Load the name of the exception that would be thrown (here an IOException)
 * **11:** Create the exception if it has a default constructor, or create a wrapper exception
 * **14:** Throw the exception

For modes other than `fault`, instructions 9 to 14 are replaced with mode-specific instructions.

### About the new mode to do short-circuit testing

Based on Instrumentation API and byte-monkey's codes, mainly update the `ByteMonkeyClassTransformer` to support new mode "scircuit", and add new code snippet into enum `OperationMode`.

- In `ByteMonkeyClassTransformer`: find the right position (beginning of try blocks) to inject codes

```java
switch (failureMode) {
    case SCIRCUIT:
        int tcIndex = arguments.tcIndex();
        if (tcIndex < 0) {
            cn.methods.stream()
                    .filter(method -> !method.name.startsWith("<"))
                    .filter(method -> filter.matches(cn.name, method.name))
                    .filter(method -> method.tryCatchBlocks.size() > 0)
                    .forEach(method -> {
                        // inject an exception in each try-catch block
                        // take the first exception type in catch block
                        // for 1 try -> n catch, we should do different injections through params
                        LabelNode ln = method.tryCatchBlocks.get(0).start;
                        int i = 0;
                        for (TryCatchBlockNode tc : method.tryCatchBlocks) {
                            if (ln == tc.start && i > 0) {
                                // if two try-catch-block-nodes have the same "start", it indicates that it's one try block with multiple catch
                                // so we should only inject one exception each time
                                continue;
                            }
                            InsnList newInstructions = failureMode.generateByteCode(tc, tcIndex, arguments);
                            method.maxStack += newInstructions.size();
                            method.instructions.insert(tc.start, newInstructions);
                            ln = tc.start;
                            i++;
                        }
                    });
        } else {
            // should work together with filter, inject an exception into specific position
            ...
        }
        break;
    default:
        ...
}
```

- In `OperationMode`: generate exception throwing method. `DirectlyThrowException` is a method who throws an exception, the type of the exception is defined in its parameter.

```java
public InsnList generateByteCode(TryCatchBlockNode tryCatchBlock, int tcIndex, AgentArguments arguments) {
    InsnList list = new InsnList();

    list.add(new LdcInsnNode(tryCatchBlock.type));
    list.add(new MethodInsnNode(
        Opcodes.INVOKESTATIC,
        "uk/co/probablyfine/bytemonkey/DirectlyThrowException",
        "throwDirectly",
        "(Ljava/lang/String;)V",
        false // this is not a method on an interface
    ));
    
    return list;
}
```
